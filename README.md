# Super lightweight and focused configuration


This setup is geared towards focusing on and using only what's necessary.

My case is a bit unique because I'm studying medicine, so I'm going to focus on this aspect and a few of my hobbies:

- Medical tools (Epidemiological analysis: Jamovi)
- Zotero
- FreeCAD
- Anki
- Notes: I love Obsidian :) or use a plain text editor
- Neovim
- Ranger (File Explorer)
- Qtile as a window manager

This is a perfect and simple approach for me; someone else might like it as much as I do, so I'm sharing it.
